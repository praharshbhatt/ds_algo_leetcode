    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A binary search tree (BST), also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree data structure whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the node’s left subtree and less than those in its right subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "A binary tree is a type of data structure for storing data such as numbers in an organized way. Binary search trees allow binary search for fast lookup, addition and removal of data items, and can be used to implement dynamic sets and lookup tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of nodes in a BST means that each comparison skips about half of the remaining tree, so the whole lookup takes time proportional to the binary logarithm of the number of items stored in the tree. This is much better than the linear time required to find items by key in an (unsorted) array, but slower than the corresponding operations on hash tables. Several variants of the binary search tree have been studied.\n",

    "\n",
    "Binary search trees support three main operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Searching: For searching element 1, we have to traverse all elements (in order 3, 2, 1). Therefore, searching in binary search tree has worst case complexity of O(n). In general, time complexity is O(h) where h is height of BST.\n",
    "2. Creation: If you do not know all the elements of BST in advance (online algorithm) then you have to insert each of n elements one after another. If you are extremely unlucky, the complexity of insert is O(n) and thus it deteriorates to O(n^2).\n",
    "Notice that this situation is highly unlikely, but still possible.\n",
    "But you can still achieve O(nlog(n)) if you know all the elements in advance. You can sort them O(nlog(n)) and then insert the elements in the following order. Take the middle element and insert it as a root, then recursively do the same for both parts that are left. You will end up creating balanced BST, inserting n elements using log(n).\n",
    "3. Insertion: For inserting element 0, it must be inserted as left child of 1. Therefore, we need to traverse all elements (in order 3, 2, 1) to insert 0 which has worst case complexity of O(n). In general, time complexity is O(h).\n",
    "4. Deletion: For deletion of element 1, we have to traverse all elements to find 1 (in order 3, 2, 1). Therefore, deletion in binary tree has worst case complexity of O(n). In general, time complexity is O(h).\n",
    "\n",

    "The latter two possibly change the structural arrangement of the nodes in the tree, whereas the first one is a navigating and read-only operation. Other read-only operations are traversal, verification, etc."

Copy the value of R to N, then recursively call delete on R until reaching one of the first two cases. If we choose the inorder successor of a node (The smallest number in the right subtree), as the right subtree is not NULL (our present case is a node with 2 children), then its inorder successor is a node with the least value in its right subtree, which will have at a maximum of 1 subtree, so deleting it would fall in one of the first 2 cases.\n",
